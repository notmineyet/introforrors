                Since my undergrad, more precisely in 2019 and onwards, I have worked with frontend, programming how the layout of an application or website should look like.
                I have experience in the creation of a brand image, from designing logos to the way standard presentations should look like in a company.
                The tools I use for my work and I'm most familiar are: JavaScript (JS), HTML, CSS, Next.Js, Figma, Python. Though recently I have started to study Angular.
                </p>
                <p id="skill_text">
                With JS I can do animations, not only to make the layout more modern and playful but also because it can come in hand depending on the purpose of the application.
                HTML and CSS are essential to create any app, I have worked with these tools for more than 5 years and I can call myself an expert. Next.JS is my favourite JS 
                platform, it is easy to understand and work with, and it helps with the more complex projects where applications need to be fluid. Figma is my personal choice to make 
                designs, logos, create background images for sections, create UX/UI designs. I have been using
                for more than 5 years too and I'm really happy with how the software elevates my designs.  While I do work with designs and programming layouts, I'm also knowledgeable in 
                Artificial Inteligence. I use Python a lot for it.

            <p> My name is Natalia and currently I'm doing grad school and research on image processing. I have always been very creative yet I didn't really wanted to be a tradional
                artist, it got boring fast for me, so my ideas and visions never left the inside of my head. Had my first ever laptop when I was only 11 years old and that is when everything
                changed. I haven't stop using a computer since then and, lucky for me, while doing my undergrad I was able to finally put my creative side to work. I could code but also make 
                pretty and fun layouts, and I haven't really stopped since. I have published some <a href="projects/project.html">designs</a> and will upload more as time goes by. 
                Feel free to email me if you want to know more.
